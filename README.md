This is a repository for my personal project of making a new calculator with python for my Intro to Computer Science course, during the Fall 2025 semester at WNCC.

My goal is to develop a fully functioning calculator using math functions.
I will be using a tkinter to create the GUI and buttons on it. 

I hope that this project will help expand my python skills particularly in the GUI area, so that I can transfer that skill to making scripts that can help me in
my professional life by making things that I can share with my colleagues to help aid in their functions.
